# Ajax Form
<br>
This is my first web app using Bootstrap - jQuery - Ajax - PHP.<br>
It's a contact form (form.html) that send data without a page refresh using AJAX (app.js).<br>
Form data will be processed by process.php file.<br>
The files are heavily commented (in italian language) because they have learning purpose.
This project contain:
- a readme file
- a form html file
- a process php file
- a app js file
- a links html file
